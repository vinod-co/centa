They allow for the more objective testing of specific facts and pieces of knowledge. This question type can be used in two different modes, one with blank textboxes for students to complete and one with a dropdown list of options that students select from.&nbsp;\r\nBlank Textboxes\r\nIn the example below it can be seen that&nbsp;4 key terms have been removed from a paragraph of text. The exam candidate is require to type in their answer into each of the blank text boxes. Rogo can support any number of blanks within a piece of text and can even have two blanks next to each other.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTo create a blank input box place [blank] and [/blank] tags around the options you wish to add in the \'Question\' field.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhere there are different spellings for words in UK and US English or acronyms the alternatives can be added as correct items. For example, both the full term and acronym shown here will be marked as correct, [blank]tyrannosaurus rex,t-rex[/blank].\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDropdown Lists\r\nThe disadvantage of a traditional fill-in-the-blank question, as shown above, is the problem of spelling. Dyslexic students and those who have made typing mistakes can be penalised by computer-based marking even though a human might see that they have got the correct answer. As an alternative to the spelling issue, Rogo can present each blank as a dropdown list with a number of pre-written distractors. In the screenshot below the same question as the first one is re-presented using these dropdown lists. Always put the correct answer as the first option, followed by the distractors (all options are randomised automatically).\r\ne.g. Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the largest dinosaurs living during the [blank]late,mid,early[/blank] [blank]Cretaceous,Triassic,Jurassic[/blank] period.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nMarking\r\nThe Marking Method can be set as either Mark per Question or by Option with the number of marks awarded for correct and incorrect responses (negative marks) set in the question.

Instead it is at the discression of the paper writer to release the marks by using the \'email class\' button at the bottom of the \'Class Totals\' report. A Progress Test can only be taken once but the paper owner may change the paper to a Formative paper which allow students to access it an see the results and feedback for each question.

In the example below, concerning questionnaire response rates, two variables are used: the first is a random number between 300 and 800 (incrementing in 100 values), and the second variable is a random integer between 10 and the calculated value of the first variable.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"image_brd\" src=\"images/calculation_question1.png\" alt=\"Calculation question presentation\" width=\"556\" height=\"145\" /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be a bit more specific the question author has explicitly stated that the answer should be expressed to one decimal place. The author has also added a \'%\' character for the units; this is added at the end of the answer textbox.</p>\r\n<h2>Marking</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the marking screen the user\'s answer is presented together with the correct answer displayed emboldened. If the user\'s answer is equal to the correct answer or within a predetermined tolerance a tick is displayed and marks awarded. The number of marks awarded for a question can be set within the editor (1 to 20), in the example below 1 mark is awarded for a correct answer. Partial marks can also be set for answers close to the correct answer. Like the marks for the correct answer, a tolerance and value is set for the partial mark.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"image_brd\" src=\"images/calculation_answer.png\" alt=\"Calculation question marking\" width=\"543\" height=\"192\" /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As can be seen in the example above the feedback, displayed in dark red, can also use the generated variables to really clarify how to calculate the answer.</p>\r\n<h2>Creating</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A calculation question consists of one or more variables used to construct a randomised question which changes each time attempted. To create the questionnaire response rate question displayed above, the following settings could be used. As shown below, two variables $A and $B are used. $A, the number of questionnaires sent out is set to be a random variable between 300 and 800. To make it more realistic the increment level is set to 100 so the only possible values that can be generated are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800. The number of responses, variable $B, is set to be between 10 and whatever value is generated for variable $A. In this case the increment level is set to 1.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer is checked against the value entered into the \'formula\' field. In the example below the basic calculation is divide $B by $A and then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage. This should be expressed using brackets to set the priority: ($B / $A) * 100. In some instances the generated values of $A and $B could result in an answer with a recurring number of decimal places. Also, the question stated that answers should be expressed to one decimal place. To do this the function \'round\' has been used (<a href=\"#functions\">see functions below</a>). A tolerance value can also be added, please note this is an absolute value. The number of marks that can be given for a correct answer may also be selected. Partial marks can be set if \'Tolerance for Partial Marks\' is set. Until Partial Marks are set the Allow partial Marks Marking Method is not available.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"image_brd\" src=\"images/edit_enhancedcalc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"945\" height=\"827\" /></p>\r\n<div>.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Student answers</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Note for very small or large number answers:</strong> students should <strong>not</strong> use exponential indication (e.g. 1e-5 or 1x10<sup>-5</sup>) for large or small numbers since this format does not register and&nbsp;they will be awarded zero.

The question to link to is selected using the link icon next to the \'Min\' and \'Max\' fields. In the example shown below, variable $B is generated from the students answer to a previous question. Even if the student answered the initial question incorrectly they can still answer the linked question correctly as it is using the answer they gave in the earlier question.

In the example below, concerning questionnaire response rates, two variables are used: the first is a random number between 300 and 800 (incrementing in 100 values), and the second variable is a random integer between 10 and the calculated value of the first variable.\r\n\r\nTo be a bit more specific the question author has explicitly stated that the answer should be expressed to one decimal place. The author has also added a \'%\' character for the units; this is added at the end of the answer textbox.\r\nMarking\r\nOn the marking screen the user\'s answer is presented together with the correct answer displayed emboldened. If the user\'s answer is equal to the correct answer or within a predetermined tolerance a tick is displayed and marks awarded. The number of marks awarded for a question can be set within the editor (1 to 20), in the example below 1 mark is awarded for a correct answer. Partial marks can also be set for answers close to the correct answer. Like the marks for the correct answer, a tolerance and value is set for the partial mark.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the example above the feedback, displayed in dark red, can also use the generated variables to really clarify how to calculate the answer.\r\nCreating\r\nA calculation question consists of one or more variables used to construct a randomised question which changes each time attempted. To create the questionnaire response rate question displayed above, the following settings could be used. As shown below, two variables $A and $B are used. $A, the number of questionnaires sent out is set to be a random variable between 300 and 800. To make it more realistic the increment level is set to 100 so the only possible values that can be generated are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800. The number of responses, variable $B, is set to be between 10 and whatever value is generated for variable $A. In this case the increment level is set to 1.\r\nThe answer is checked against the value entered into the \'formula\' field. In the example below the basic calculation is divide $B by $A and then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage. This should be expressed using brackets to set the priority: ($B / $A) * 100. In some instances the generated values of $A and $B could result in an answer with a recurring number of decimal places. Also, the question stated that answers should be expressed to one decimal place. To do this the function \'round\' has been used (see functions below). A tolerance value can also be added, please note this is an absolute value. The number of marks that can be given for a correct answer may also be selected. Partial marks can be set if \'Tolerance for Partial Marks\' is set. Until Partial Marks are set the Allow partial Marks Marking Method is not available.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nStudent answers\r\nNote for very small or large number answers: students should not use exponential indication (e.g. 1e-5 or 1x10-5) for large or small numbers since this format does not register and&nbsp;they will be awarded zero. The units of each answer, where required, should be stated next to the answer box.\r\n\r\nLinked questions\r\nIt is possible to link two different calculation questions together by using the student\'s answer to the first question in the latter question. The question to link to is selected using the link icon next to the \'Min\' and \'Max\' fields. In the example shown below, variable $B is generated from the students answer to a previous question. Even if the student answered the initial question incorrectly they can still answer the linked question correctly as it is using the answer they gave in the earlier question. The same process can be used to use the same variables between questions on different screens.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote1: As student answers are stored as they move between screens, questions must be on different screens to allow a student\'s answer to be used in a following question. If a student has not answered the earlier question warnings will appear and the answer textbox disabled.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote2: If you copy linked questions to another paper the variable links will need to be reset\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFunctions\r\nAny of the following functions can be used in the answer formula.

See the \'External Examiners\' help page for further details.\r\nTrack Changes\r\nDetails of changes made to a question after the Peer and External Examiner reviews are recorded by Rogo and can be viewed from the question editor. The screenshot below shows the details that are recorded.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPaper/Question Locking\r\nOnce a summative exam has run, the paper and all questions that it links to are locked and cannot be amended. This ensures that the questions in the bank accurately match the results of the exam.\r\nQuestion Correction\r\nWhen analysing the results of an exam you may find that an unexpected number of students have been marked as incorrectly answering a particular question. Although questions are locked after a summative exam has run, if the correct answer for a question has been set incorrectly it is possible to change this post exam. The answer for the question can be changed in the question editor, clicking the \'Correct\' button then allows Rogo to recalculate the student marks. Please note: it is not possible to change any other parts of the question and it is also not possible to correct \'Labelling\' and \'Fill-in-the-Blank\' questions. For further information see the \'Correcting Mistakes\' help page.\r\nQuestion Exclusion\r\nIf after analysing the results of an exam it is decided that a question has not effectively assessed student knowledge it is possible to exclude it from the results. For further details look at the \'Excluding Questions Post Exam\' help page.','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'en',198,'2014-09-01 15:56:59'),(199,'Advice on/Security','<h2>Importance</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rogo holds large quantities of highly important data which must be kept safe at all times.

It is similar to the illustration above but with the addition of the green <strong>Start</strong> button. When all students in the lab have successfully logged in to Rogo the invigilator should press the <strong>Start</strong> button and announce to the students that they can begin.</p>\r\n<p>Pressing the Start button will set an end time for the exam based on the current time (when the button was pressed) plus the exam duration. For example, if the button is pressed at 10:02 and the duration of the exam is 90 minutes then an end time of 11:32 will be set <em>for the current lab</em>. If the exam is spread over multiple labs then the Start button must be pressed by an invigilator in each of the rooms to set the individual end time for that lab.</p>\r\n<p>If any students have extra time allocated in their accessibility setting then this will be displayed in the <em>Extension (mins)</em> column of the student list and automatically added to the end time of the exam for that student.<br /><br /><img class=\"image_brd\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;\" src=\"images/invigilator_timed1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"891\" height=\"297\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once the start button has been pressed the exam screen changes to something similar to the image below.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img class=\"image_brd\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;\" src=\"images/invigilator_timed2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"891\" height=\"297\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Extending exams for an entire lab</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>If there is a problem that affects access to Rogo for all students in a lab then the invigilator may opt to extend the length of the exam to compensate. This is done by changing the time in the drop-down lists below the <strong>End At</strong> button shown in the image above and then clicking the button itself. For example, in the exam shown in the image, if the invigilator wanted to provide a 10 minute extension for all students in the lab then they would change the time in the drop-down lists from <em>13:19</em> to <em>13:29</em> and then click the <strong>End At</strong> button.

This information can then be used in exam boards where appropriate. An example use of this would be if a student\'s computer locks up and they have to be moved to another machine. The invigilator, after they have helped the student move, should go back to the workstation they are logged into and scroll down the list of candidates to find the relevant student name. Single click on the name will bring up a pop-up menu as shown in the section <strong><em>Extending exams for individual students</em></strong> above.

This information could be useful in the event the student was suspected of cheating. To record a break the invigilator should locate the student in the cohort list and click on their name. In the popup menu select \'Toilet Break\'.

No access is given to the main Rogo staff screens, just some additional support they may require on the day.\r\nTo log in, the invigilator should start a web browser and go to: $local_server. The log in details are available from the unit responsible for organising summative exams. Once the invigilator has logged in, Rogo will look for a paper set for the current lab.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nProblems finding Exams\r\nUnrecognised Invigilator Computer\r\nThe first problem that an invigilator may encounter is the computer they are attempting to use as an invigilator workstation is not recognised by Rogo. The IP address or hostname has not been entered into the correct computer lab. This can only be solved by a user with SysAdmin rights. The invigilator will need to ring an emergency number for help.\r\n\r\nNo Papers Available\r\nThe first problem that an invigilator may encounter is no paper found for the current lab. This could be caused by the wrong lab being selected or the dates incorrectly set. The invigilator cannot change the properties of the paper&nbsp;but should try one of the emergency&nbsp;telephone numbers that is listed on the screen notifying the problem.\r\n\r\nStudent Can\'t Log In\r\nGuest Accounts can be used for any student who are having difficulty logging into a summative exam. There are one hundred guest accounts that can be used for any exam.\r\nExam timing\r\nExams in Rogo may optionally be either timed automatically or un-timed (under invigilator control). Exam timing is switched on or off through Module settings and will apply to all summative exams within that module.\r\nTimed exams\r\nFor timed exams, a fixed end time can be set by the invigilator and the exam will end automatically at that point. The students&rsquo; data will be saved under the control of the software. Students will not be able to re-start the exam after its end time has been reached.\r\nThe end time is set on a per-lab basis. This means that if an exam is taking place in more than one location and a delay occurs in in one of the labs then those students will not be bound by an end time set in a different lab that has not suffered delays.\r\nAny additional time that has been defined for a student in Accessibility settings will be automatically added to the length of the exam for that student alone.\r\nInvigilators are able to extend the exam either for an individual student, if they had to change computer for example, or for the whole lab if there was a disruption that affected the entire room.\r\nNon-timed exams\r\nIf the module is not set to allow timed exams then the starting and ending of the exam should be carried out verbally by the invigilators.\r\nExam Screen\r\nAssuming a paper has been correctly set for the right computer lab and time, a screen similar to the one below will be displayed. A tabbed interface is employed for potentially multiple exams scheduled for the same computer lab. The first tab is always \'Exam Checklist\' which reminds invigilators of the steps they should be taking pre-exam, mid-exam and post-exam.\r\n\r\nThe other tabs (see screenshot below) show all the exams scheduled for the current lab at the current time. The exam tab has the following parts\r\n\r\nLog out button\r\nStart/end time information and duration.\r\nTelephone numbers to ring in case of emergency.\r\n\'Add Paper Note...\' button allows an invigilator to record a problem which affect the whole cohort or paper. A good example of this would be to record a problem with a particular question.\r\n\'View Rubric\' will allow the invigilator to see the rubric that the students can see on their initial screen.\r\nThis is a list of all the students in the modules that have been assigned to the current paper. Any students will additional time will have their end time displayed in bold.\r\nThe \'Exam question clarifications\' section checks every few seconds for system messages. This can be used by the central exams unit to add messages to questions and for these to be relayed to students and the invigilators.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirements\r\nExtra Time\r\nStudents permitted extra time due to dyslexia or other reasons will have their end time listed in bold. The figure to the right is the amount of extra time (specified in minutes) given.\r\nRest Breaks\r\nIf a student has been set to be allowed specific breaks, a cresent moon icon will be displayed. Rolling over this will show the details of the breaks in a callout (see below).\r\n\r\nMedical Conditions\r\nIf a student has any medial information set then a green medical icon will be displayed. Rolling over this will show details of the medical condition (see below).\r\n\r\nNon-Timed Exams\r\nThe Exam Screen illustrated above shows a non-timed exam. The end time shown in the top left of the screen&nbsp;is based on the start time defined in the paper&rsquo;s properties plus its defined duration.

Some definitions stress that a learning objective is a sort of contract that teachers make with learners that describes what they will be able to do after learning that they could not do before, the \'added value\' of teaching. However the connection between teaching and learning is not a simple one. Just because knowledge or skills are taught does not mean that particular knowledge or skills are learned. Many factors can interfere with the achievement of objectives: the existing knowledge of the learner, the relevance or usefulness of the material presented, the skills of the teacher.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Objectives are the \'desired outcomes\' of student learning and need to be set for the course both at the module and session levels. Assessments then need to be referenced to these objectives to allow them to report on the results of the teaching. Alignment between the desired outcome, how we teach and how we assess is likely to achieve more effective teaching.</div>\r\n<p><a name=\"difference\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>What are the difference between Aims and Objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"difference\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aims are general statements concerning the overall goals, ends or intentions of teaching. Objectives are the individual stages that learners must achieve on the way in order to reach these goals. For example a teacher might have an aim that a student should be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. However to achieve this aim a series of objectives must be met. e.g. to explain procedure to patient, to position cuff correctly, to inflate to correct pressure etc., etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lecturer might have as an overall aim that students should understand the relationship between protein structure and function. To achieve this aim the following objectives might have to be met: describe amino acid structure, list common categories of amino acid, explain how peptide bonds are formed, describe how covalent, ionic and hydrophobic interactions create secondary and tertiary structures, etc., etc.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are general, objectives are specific.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>There are more objectives than aims.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are like strategy, objective are like tactics.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aims and objectives can form hierarchical structures so that in complex curricula aims at one level might be seen as objectives at another.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>What are the main categories of learning objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learning objectives are aimed at the three domains of learning: knowledge, skills and attitudes.

Many things can be potentially learned during a teaching episode but you will use your judgement to focus on the most important outcomes for your learners at that stage of their course. For instance if you want them to be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer after you have demonstrated the procedure that would constitute your aim. But to achieve that they will have to have attained a series of objectives on the way. Some of these objectives might include the basic knowledge behind cardiovascular physiology such as the sequence of the cardiac cycle, systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume etc. etc. Further skill objectives might include communicating with patients, explaining procedures etc. Finally the skills of the procedure itself broken down into suitable steps. So the aims and objectives for one possible teaching sequence might look like the following:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid black; width: 85%; background-color: #ffffee;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Aims:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The student should be able to measure blood pressure on a colleague/patient using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (to an accuracy of +/- 10mm Hg).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Can describe the cardiac cycle and explain the terms systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Can effectively communicate instructions to patient concerning the procedure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Fits and inflates cuff to appropriate pressure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Releases pressure carefully and uses stethoscope to listen to brachial artery and Korotkow sounds.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Deflates cuff.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Records systolic and diastolic pressure correctly.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the case of more knowledge orientated aims and objectives imagine you are going to give a lecture with the aim of ensuring that students understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the various factors that influence enzyme reactions.

Learning Objectives are statements that describe what a learner will be able to do as a result of learning. They are sometimes called learning outcomes. Learning Objectives are also statements that describe what a learner will be able to do as a result of teaching. Some definitions stress that a learning objective is a sort of contract that teachers make with learners that describes what they will be able to do after learning that they could not do before, the \'added value\' of teaching. However the connection between teaching and learning is not a simple one. Just because knowledge or skills are taught does not mean that particular knowledge or skills are learned. Many factors can interfere with the achievement of objectives: the existing knowledge of the learner, the relevance or usefulness of the material presented, the skills of the teacher. &nbsp; Objectives are the \'desired outcomes\' of student learning and need to be set for the course both at the module and session levels. Assessments then need to be referenced to these objectives to allow them to report on the results of the teaching. Alignment between the desired outcome, how we teach and how we assess is likely to achieve more effective teaching. What are the difference between Aims and Objectives? Aims are general statements concerning the overall goals, ends or intentions of teaching. Objectives are the individual stages that learners must achieve on the way in order to reach these goals. For example a teacher might have an aim that a student should be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. However to achieve this aim a series of objectives must be met. e.g. to explain procedure to patient, to position cuff correctly, to inflate to correct pressure etc., etc. A lecturer might have as an overall aim that students should understand the relationship between protein structure and function. To achieve this aim the following objectives might have to be met: describe amino acid structure, list common categories of amino acid, explain how peptide bonds are formed, describe how covalent, ionic and hydrophobic interactions create secondary and tertiary structures, etc., etc.  Aims are general, objectives are specific.  There are more objectives than aims.  Aims are like strategy, objective are like tactics.  Aims and objectives can form hierarchical structures so that in complex curricula aims at one level might be seen as objectives at another. What are the main categories of learning objectives? Learning objectives are aimed at the three domains of learning: knowledge, skills and attitudes. These are also termed the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains of learning. How do you write aims and learning objectives? As a teacher you will need to decide what you want your learners to be able to DO after they have learned something that you have taught. Many things can be potentially learned during a teaching episode but you will use your judgement to focus on the most important outcomes for your learners at that stage of their course. For instance if you want them to be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer after you have demonstrated the procedure that would constitute your aim. But to achieve that they will have to have attained a series of objectives on the way. Some of these objectives might include the basic knowledge behind cardiovascular physiology such as the sequence of the cardiac cycle, systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume etc. etc. Further skill objectives might include communicating with patients, explaining procedures etc. Finally the skills of the procedure itself broken down into suitable steps. So the aims and objectives for one possible teaching sequence might look like the following:   Aims: The student should be able to measure blood pressure on a colleague/patient using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (to an accuracy of +/- 10mm Hg). Objectives:  Can describe the cardiac cycle and explain the terms systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume.  Can effectively communicate instructions to patient concerning the procedure.  Fits and inflates cuff to appropriate pressure.  Releases pressure carefully and uses stethoscope to listen to brachial artery and Korotkow sounds.  Deflates cuff.  Records systolic and diastolic pressure correctly.    In the case of more knowledge orientated aims and objectives imagine you are going to give a lecture with the aim of ensuring that students understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the various factors that influence enzyme reactions. Here you need to break the knowledge down into smaller components that logically build towards the final goal.   Aims: To understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the factors that influence enzyme reactions. Objectives:  State the different categories of amino acid.  Explain what a peptide bond is and how polypeptides are formed.  State the four levels of protein structure and explain how the sequence of amino acids leads to the final three dimensional configuration of the protein.  Explain how variations in pH, ion concentration and temperature influence the three dimensional configuration of a protein.  State that an enzyme is a protein designed to catalyse a specific chemical reaction.  State that an enzyme speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy of the transition complex and that it does not influence the equilibrium or overall energy change of a reaction.  Explain how variations in pH, ion concentration and temperature influence catalytic activity.  Describe how enzyme activity can be regulated by other molecules.    Note that objectives do not include the word \'know\' or \'understand\'. They do include active verbs such as \'state\', \'explain\', \'outline\', \'list\' or \'describe\'. Know and understand do not specify any overt \'doing\' and although knowing and understanding underpin learning, objectives are always written using active doing verbs. They are statements of what you want your learners to do. At the end of the day being a doctor, nurse or dentist is about doing things not just knowing things.

There are a number of different methods available to perform this process; two of the more frequently used include the Angoff method (used for GEM exams) and the Ebel method (most frequently used). Both processes employ a panel of subject matter experts (SMEs) to determine whether a borderline candidate would be expected to get the current question correct or not.\r\nAdvantages\r\n\r\n\r\nThey focus attention on item content\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are relatively easy to use\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable body of published work supporting their use\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are used frequently in high stakes testing\r\n\r\n\r\nDisadvantages\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concept of a \"borderline group\" is sometimes difficult to define\r\n\r\n\r\nJudges sometimes feel they are \"pulling numbers out of the air\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods can be tedious\r\n\r\n\r\nSelection of panellists\r\nThe selection of panellists in standard setting is of the greatest importance.

In this example, one mark&nbsp;is awarded for correctly selected options with a bonus mark awarded for ranking these in the correct order.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMarking\r\nThere are number of different ways of marking a ranking question:\r\n\r\nMark per option\r\nThe correct&nbsp;mark set for the question is awarded for each item in the correct order. Zero marks (or the incorrect mark)&nbsp;awarded per item for any options in the wrong position.\r\n\r\nMark per question\r\nAll options in the list have to be correctly ranked to be awarded&nbsp;the Correct&nbsp;mark as set in the question. If any option is incorrectly ordered then zero (or the incorrect mark)&nbsp;is scored for the question.\r\n\r\nAllow partial Marks\r\nThe&nbsp;mark set for correct answers&nbsp;is awarded for each item in the correct order.&nbsp;Partial marks are awarded for items that are only one number out. For example, if a user put 2nd or 4th as the position of&nbsp;an item that should be ranked 3rd&nbsp;then this would be awarded the partial mark set for the question. Any other answers are awarded zero or the mark set for incorrect answers.\r\n\r\nBonus Mark\r\nOne mark is awarded for each option that is applicable (i.e. should be included in the ranking) irrespective of position. A bonus mark will be added to this score if all the appropriate options are also in the correct order.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'cs',20,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(365,'Question - Types/Matrix','<h2>Presentation</h2>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Matrix questions can be thought of as conceptually quite similar to extended matching.

If the user\'s answer is equal to the correct answer or within a predetermined tolerance a tick is displayed and marks awarded. The number of marks awarded for a question can be set within the editor (1 to 20), in the example below 1 mark is awarded for a correct answer.

To create the questionnaire response rate question displayed above, the following settings could be used. As shown below, two variables $A and $B are used. $A, the number of questionnaires sent out is set to be a random variable between 300 and 800. To make it more realistic the increment level is set to 100 so the only possible values that can be generated are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800. The number of responses, variable $B, is set to be between 10 and whatever value is generated for variable $A. In this case the increment level is set to 1.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer is checked against the value entered into the \'formula\' field. In the example below the basic calculation is divide $B by $A and then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage. This should be expressed using brackets to set the priority: ($B / $A) * 100. In some instances the generated values of $A and $B could result in an answer with a recurring number of decimal places. Also, the question stated that answers should be expressed to one decimal place. To do this the function \'round\' has been used (<a href=\"#functions\">see functions below</a>). A tolerance value can also be added, please note this is an absolute value. The number of marks that can be given for a correct answer may also be selected. Partial marks can be set if \'Tolerance for Partial Marks\' is set.

The units of each answer, where required, should be stated next to the answer box.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Linked questions</h2>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is possible to link two different calculation questions together by using the student\'s answer to the first question in the latter question. The question to link to is selected using the link icon next to the \'Min\' and \'Max\' fields. In the example shown below, variable $B is generated from the students answer to a previous question. Even if the student answered the initial question incorrectly they can still answer the linked question correctly as it is using the answer they gave in the earlier question. The same process can be used to use the same variables between questions on different screens.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Note1:</strong> As student answers are stored as they move between screens, questions must be on different screens to allow a student\'s answer to be used in a following question.

To make it more realistic the increment level is set to 100 so the only possible values that can be generated are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800. The number of responses, variable $B, is set to be between 10 and whatever value is generated for variable $A. In this case the increment level is set to 1.\r\nThe answer is checked against the value entered into the \'formula\' field. In the example below the basic calculation is divide $B by $A and then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage. This should be expressed using brackets to set the priority: ($B / $A) * 100. In some instances the generated values of $A and $B could result in an answer with a recurring number of decimal places. Also, the question stated that answers should be expressed to one decimal place. To do this the function \'round\' has been used (see functions below). A tolerance value can also be added, please note this is an absolute value. The number of marks that can be given for a correct answer may also be selected. Partial marks can be set if \'Tolerance for Partial Marks\' is set. Until Partial Marks are set the Allow partial Marks Marking Method is not available.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nStudent answers\r\nNote for very small or large number answers: students should not use exponential indication (e.g. 1e-5 or 1x10-5) for large or small numbers since this format does not register and&nbsp;they will be awarded zero. The units of each answer, where required, should be stated next to the answer box.\r\n\r\nLinked questions\r\nIt is possible to link two different calculation questions together by using the student\'s answer to the first question in the latter question. The question to link to is selected using the link icon next to the \'Min\' and \'Max\' fields. In the example shown below, variable $B is generated from the students answer to a previous question. Even if the student answered the initial question incorrectly they can still answer the linked question correctly as it is using the answer they gave in the earlier question. The same process can be used to use the same variables between questions on different screens.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote1: As student answers are stored as they move between screens, questions must be on different screens to allow a student\'s answer to be used in a following question. If a student has not answered the earlier question warnings will appear and the answer textbox disabled.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote2: If you copy linked questions to another paper the variable links will need to be reset\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFunctions\r\nAny of the following functions can be used in the answer formula. [x] and [y] represent variable parameters which the functions require. For example, to round a number to two decimal places the following can be written:\r\nround($A,2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunction\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabs([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolute value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacos([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nArc cosine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacosh([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nInverse hyperbolic cosine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasin([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nArc sine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasinh([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nInverse hyperbolic sine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\natan2([y],[x])\r\n\r\n\r\nArc tangent of two variables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\natan([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nArc tangent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\natanh([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nInverse hyperbolic tangent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nceil([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nRound fractions up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncos([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nCosine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosh([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nHyperbolic cosine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeg2rad([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nConverts the number in degrees to the radian equivalent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexp([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nCalculates the exponent of e (the Neperian or Natural logarithm base)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpm1([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns exp(number) - 1, computed in a way that is accurate even when the value of number is close to zero\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfloor([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nRound fractions down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfmod([x],[y])\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns the floating point remainder (modulo) of the division of the arguments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlog10([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nBase-10 logarithm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlog1p([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns log(1 + number), computed in a way that is accurate even when the value of number is close to zero\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlog([x],[base])\r\n\r\n\r\nlogarithm (the [base] parameter is optional defaults to \'e\' and so to the natural logarithm if not provided)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmax([x],[y],...)\r\n\r\n\r\nFind highest value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmin([x],[y],...)\r\n\r\n\r\nFind lowest value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npi()\r\n\r\n\r\nGet value of pi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npow([x],[exp])\r\n\r\n\r\nExponential expression\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nround([x],[decimals])\r\n\r\n\r\nRounds a float to [decimals] number of places\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsin([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nSine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsinh([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nHyperbolic sine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsqrt([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nSquare root\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntan([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nTangent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntanh([x])\r\n\r\n\r\nHyperbolic tangent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'cs',68,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(393,'Fire Exits','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The \'fire exit\' icon will only appear when in summative exams.

Creating Accounts\r\nEach external examiner must have their own authentication account when reviewing papers in Rogo. New accounts may be created by emailing $support_email. External examiners will automatically be sent an email with their log in details when their accounts are first created.\r\n2. Assigning Examiners to Papers\r\nExternal examiners are assigned to papers by means of the \'Edit Properties\' dialog box. Click on the \'Reviewers\' tab on the left hand side and select all the examiners who are required to review the current paper. Importantly, remember to set a deadline by which time all externals should have completed their review. This deadline should typically be a couple of weeks before the intended exam date to allow time for any changes to be made to the assessment. External examiners will lose access to papers automatically on expiry of the deadline.\r\n\r\n3. Contacting Externals\r\nIt is the role of the module convenor to contact any external examiners connected with an examination. To do this there is an email facility built into Rogo. From within the paper set for review click on \'Email Externals\' from the sidebar menu and then select \'Initial Invitation\'.\r\n\r\nOn the next screen will be presented a list of all the external examiners set for the current paper. Each examiner will need to be emailed separately. Click on the button of the external you wish to email, in this case we will click on \'Professor Mclaughlin\'.\r\n\r\nAn email template will now be displayed with a default message. This message can be edited with extra information if needed. By default the \'Cc\' field will have the email of the person sending the email. Other addresses can be added if necessary. When happy with the message click \'Email\' at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n4. Examiners Logging In\r\nWhen Rogo detects an external logging into $local_server it will redirect the user to a special screen which displays only those papers that require attention from the current external. The screenshot below shows a fictitious example of a resit papers that have been set for review by Dr McCartney. Only papers with future availability dates are shown, past dates are assumed to have been sat by examinees and so no longer need reviewing.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n5.

Rogo can be configured so that it automatically calculates the mark which would be expected if a candidate answered all questions at random. This mark is then subtracted from a real candidate\'s performance, it is subtracted from the total possible marks for the paper, and then the new candidate mark is expressed as a percentage out of the new paper mark.\r\nTo calculate the random mark there is a setting, see below, in the paper properties dialog box:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote 1: An alternative Marking method is to standards set the paper.

A student could, for example, get one question right and one wrong, this would give an average of 50% acquisition and therefore be displayed as the amber icon. The key below gives further details.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIcons\r\nGreen=wholly/mainly achieved, Amber=partially achieved, and Red=mainly not achieved.\r\nYour Mark\r\nShows the number of marks of questions linked to each objective together with the number of marks you actually scored on these questions.\r\nRelative\r\nShow the average number of marks relative to the whole cohort. So, for example, a score of +0.1 means you scored 0.1 more marks than students in the cohort did on average for this learning objective.\r\nQ no\r\nThe number of questions linked to a particular learning objective.\r\nObjective\r\nThe text of the learning objective itself.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAt the bottom of the above report (not shown on graphic) is a distribution bar chart which shows the range of performance of the whole cohort and then plots the individual student\'s performance against this. This allows the student to see how well they are doing in comparison with their peers.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIf you want to provide objectives feedback for students the \'Objectives-based Feedback\'&nbsp;is selected to provide the URL for the feedback which can then be sent to students (or a link provided in the VLE).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\nObjectives/Overview\r\n','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'cs',145,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(429,'Marking/Variable Marks','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The number of marks awarded for correct answers can be set individually for each question.

It is similar to the illustration above but with the addition of the green <strong>Start</strong> button. When all students in the lab have successfully logged in to Rogo the invigilator should press the <strong>Start</strong> button and announce to the students that they can begin.</p>\r\n<p>Pressing the Start button will set an end time for the exam based on the current time (when the button was pressed) plus the exam duration. For example, if the button is pressed at 10:02 and the duration of the exam is 90 minutes then an end time of 11:32 will be set <em>for the current lab</em>. If the exam is spread over multiple labs then the Start button must be pressed by an invigilator in each of the rooms to set the individual end time for that lab.</p>\r\n<p>If any students have extra time allocated in their accessibility setting then this will be displayed in the <em>Extension (mins)</em> column of the student list and automatically added to the end time of the exam for that student.<br /><br /><img class=\"image_brd\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;\" src=\"images/invigilator_timed1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"891\" height=\"297\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once the start button has been pressed the exam screen changes to something similar to the image below.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img class=\"image_brd\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;\" src=\"images/invigilator_timed2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"891\" height=\"297\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Extending exams for an entire lab</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>If there is a problem that affects access to Rogo for all students in a lab then the invigilator may opt to extend the length of the exam to compensate. This is done by changing the time in the drop-down lists below the <strong>End At</strong> button shown in the image above and then clicking the button itself. For example, in the exam shown in the image, if the invigilator wanted to provide a 10 minute extension for all students in the lab then they would change the time in the drop-down lists from <em>13:19</em> to <em>13:29</em> and then click the <strong>End At</strong> button.

This information can then be used in exam boards where appropriate. An example use of this would be if a student\'s computer locks up and they have to be moved to another machine. The invigilator, after they have helped the student move, should go back to the workstation they are logged into and scroll down the list of candidates to find the relevant student name. Single click on the name will bring up a pop-up menu as shown in the section <strong><em>Extending exams for individual students</em></strong> above.

This information could be useful in the event the student was suspected of cheating. To record a break the invigilator should locate the student in the cohort list and click on their name. In the popup menu select \'Toilet Break\'.

No access is given to the main Rogo staff screens, just some additional support they may require on the day.\r\nTo log in, the invigilator should start a web browser and go to: $local_server. The log in details are available from the unit responsible for organising summative exams. Once the invigilator has logged in, Rogo will look for a paper set for the current lab.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nProblems finding Exams\r\nUnrecognised Invigilator Computer\r\nThe first problem that an invigilator may encounter is the computer they are attempting to use as an invigilator workstation is not recognised by Rogo. The IP address or hostname has not been entered into the correct computer lab. This can only be solved by a user with SysAdmin rights. The invigilator will need to ring an emergency number for help.\r\n\r\nNo Papers Available\r\nThe first problem that an invigilator may encounter is no paper found for the current lab. This could be caused by the wrong lab being selected or the dates incorrectly set. The invigilator cannot change the properties of the paper&nbsp;but should try one of the emergency&nbsp;telephone numbers that is listed on the screen notifying the problem.\r\n\r\nStudent Can\'t Log In\r\nGuest Accounts can be used for any student who are having difficulty logging into a summative exam. There are one hundred guest accounts that can be used for any exam.\r\nExam timing\r\nExams in Rogo may optionally be either timed automatically or un-timed (under invigilator control). Exam timing is switched on or off through Module settings and will apply to all summative exams within that module.\r\nTimed exams\r\nFor timed exams, a fixed end time can be set by the invigilator and the exam will end automatically at that point. The students&rsquo; data will be saved under the control of the software. Students will not be able to re-start the exam after its end time has been reached.\r\nThe end time is set on a per-lab basis. This means that if an exam is taking place in more than one location and a delay occurs in in one of the labs then those students will not be bound by an end time set in a different lab that has not suffered delays.\r\nAny additional time that has been defined for a student in Accessibility settings will be automatically added to the length of the exam for that student alone.\r\nInvigilators are able to extend the exam either for an individual student, if they had to change computer for example, or for the whole lab if there was a disruption that affected the entire room.\r\nNon-timed exams\r\nIf the module is not set to allow timed exams then the starting and ending of the exam should be carried out verbally by the invigilators.\r\nExam Screen\r\nAssuming a paper has been correctly set for the right computer lab and time, a screen similar to the one below will be displayed. A tabbed interface is employed for potentially multiple exams scheduled for the same computer lab. The first tab is always \'Exam Checklist\' which reminds invigilators of the steps they should be taking pre-exam, mid-exam and post-exam.\r\n\r\nThe other tabs (see screenshot below) show all the exams scheduled for the current lab at the current time. The exam tab has the following parts\r\n\r\nLog out button\r\nStart/end time information and duration.\r\nTelephone numbers to ring in case of emergency.\r\n\'Add Paper Note...\' button allows an invigilator to record a problem which affect the whole cohort or paper. A good example of this would be to record a problem with a particular question.\r\n\'View Rubric\' will allow the invigilator to see the rubric that the students can see on their initial screen.\r\nThis is a list of all the students in the modules that have been assigned to the current paper. Any students will additional time will have their end time displayed in bold.\r\nThe \'Exam question clarifications\' section checks every few seconds for system messages. This can be used by the central exams unit to add messages to questions and for these to be relayed to students and the invigilators.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirements\r\nExtra Time\r\nStudents permitted extra time due to dyslexia or other reasons will have their end time listed in bold. The figure to the right is the amount of extra time (specified in minutes) given.\r\nRest Breaks\r\nIf a student has been set to be allowed specific breaks, a cresent moon icon will be displayed. Rolling over this will show the details of the breaks in a callout (see below).\r\n\r\nMedical Conditions\r\nIf a student has any medial information set then a green medical icon will be displayed. Rolling over this will show details of the medical condition (see below).\r\n\r\nNon-Timed Exams\r\nThe Exam Screen illustrated above shows a non-timed exam. The end time shown in the top left of the screen&nbsp;is based on the start time defined in the paper&rsquo;s properties plus its defined duration.

The start and end of the exam&nbsp;remain under the control of the invigilators who must announce to the room when students may start and when they must finish answering questions.\r\nUnfinishing Exams\r\nWhen a student clicks \'Finish\' this will be recorded by the system. If the student attempts to re-enter the same summative exam they will receive an access denied warning. If a student has clicked on \'Finish\' by mistake this can be reset by in invigilator. To do this the invigilator should click on the student name and select \'Set to unfinished\' from the popup menu.\r\n\r\nIn the next screen they should click \'OK\'.

Some definitions stress that a learning objective is a sort of contract that teachers make with learners that describes what they will be able to do after learning that they could not do before, the \'added value\' of teaching. However the connection between teaching and learning is not a simple one. Just because knowledge or skills are taught does not mean that particular knowledge or skills are learned. Many factors can interfere with the achievement of objectives: the existing knowledge of the learner, the relevance or usefulness of the material presented, the skills of the teacher.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Objectives are the \'desired outcomes\' of student learning and need to be set for the course both at the module and session levels. Assessments then need to be referenced to these objectives to allow them to report on the results of the teaching. Alignment between the desired outcome, how we teach and how we assess is likely to achieve more effective teaching.</div>\r\n<p><a name=\"difference\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>What are the difference between Aims and Objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"difference\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aims are general statements concerning the overall goals, ends or intentions of teaching. Objectives are the individual stages that learners must achieve on the way in order to reach these goals. For example a teacher might have an aim that a student should be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. However to achieve this aim a series of objectives must be met. e.g. to explain procedure to patient, to position cuff correctly, to inflate to correct pressure etc., etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lecturer might have as an overall aim that students should understand the relationship between protein structure and function. To achieve this aim the following objectives might have to be met: describe amino acid structure, list common categories of amino acid, explain how peptide bonds are formed, describe how covalent, ionic and hydrophobic interactions create secondary and tertiary structures, etc., etc.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are general, objectives are specific.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>There are more objectives than aims.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are like strategy, objective are like tactics.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aims and objectives can form hierarchical structures so that in complex curricula aims at one level might be seen as objectives at another.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>What are the main categories of learning objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learning objectives are aimed at the three domains of learning: knowledge, skills and attitudes.

Many things can be potentially learned during a teaching episode but you will use your judgement to focus on the most important outcomes for your learners at that stage of their course. For instance if you want them to be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer after you have demonstrated the procedure that would constitute your aim. But to achieve that they will have to have attained a series of objectives on the way. Some of these objectives might include the basic knowledge behind cardiovascular physiology such as the sequence of the cardiac cycle, systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume etc. etc. Further skill objectives might include communicating with patients, explaining procedures etc. Finally the skills of the procedure itself broken down into suitable steps. So the aims and objectives for one possible teaching sequence might look like the following:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid black; width: 85%; background-color: #ffffee;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Aims:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The student should be able to measure blood pressure on a colleague/patient using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (to an accuracy of +/- 10mm Hg).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Can describe the cardiac cycle and explain the terms systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Can effectively communicate instructions to patient concerning the procedure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Fits and inflates cuff to appropriate pressure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Releases pressure carefully and uses stethoscope to listen to brachial artery and Korotkow sounds.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Deflates cuff.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Records systolic and diastolic pressure correctly.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the case of more knowledge orientated aims and objectives imagine you are going to give a lecture with the aim of ensuring that students understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the various factors that influence enzyme reactions.

Students are free to learn more if they so wish but learning objectives should define the \'bottom line\'. Individual teachers may wish that students learn more about their own favourite areas but this has to be seen in the context of the overall curriculum and has to be argued with the appropriate course co-ordinator or curriculum committee.

In the case of the medical curriculum having many sessions without pre-defined learning objectives leads to a \'hidden\' curriculum rather than the goal of an integrated curriculum.\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages of using learning objectives?\r\n\r\nFrom an educational perspective learning objectives define learning outcomes and focus teaching. They help to clarify, organize and prioritize learning. They help students evaluate their own progress and encourage them to take responsibility for their learning.\r\n\r\nI want my students to \'read around the subject\'. Don\'t learning objectives narrow the range of student learning?\r\n\r\nMedicine is such an enormous subject that some boundaries have to be placed on the learning required to become a pre-registration house officer. The General Medical Council in Tomorrow\'s Doctors specifically recommended a reduction in factual knowledge. Specific aims and learning objectives are therefore essential in defining core knowledge, skills and attitudes. Students are free to learn more if they so wish but learning objectives should define the \'bottom line\'. Individual teachers may wish that students learn more about their own favourite areas but this has to be seen in the context of the overall curriculum and has to be argued with the appropriate course co-ordinator or curriculum committee. On the other hand if it is decided that \'reading around the subject\' is a fundamental requirement of some components of the course then appropriate learning objectives can be defined for this outcome.\r\n\r\nWe have module objectives, why do we need objectives for individual teaching sessions?\r\n\r\nFrom a curriculum perspective the learning objectives from each taught session should fit together coherently, building towards the overall aims of each module and the whole curriculum. If learning objectives are not known for each session then it is impossible to see how the whole curriculum fits together. It becomes impossible for teachers in different phases of the curriculum to see what students have learned in other areas making managing and auditing the curriculum more difficult. In the case of the medical curriculum having many sessions without pre-defined learning objectives leads to a \'hidden\' curriculum rather than the goal of an integrated curriculum.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSession objectives are mapped to assessment questions in Rogo meaning that the exams results can provide a report on the effectiveness of teaching of the objectives.','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'cs',226,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(475,'Equation Editor','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Equations Editor is used to&nbsp;include equations within text fields when creating questions.

This allows for a student to have different values for the same category of data. For example, a student on Module001 could be in Project Group 1a and in Module002 could be in Project Group 3b. It does not matter that the metadata category is the same (i.e. \'Project Group\') the system is working within different modules.\r\nInitial&nbsp;Metadata Importing\r\nTo add metadata to students you should select the module you wish to add the metadata to firstly. There is then an \'Add Metadata\' icon under the \'Users\' section.\r\n\r\nA&nbsp;CSV file needs to be created with student usernames&nbsp;in the first column then the required metadata in the following columns. The example below is loading&nbsp;two pieces of metadata information per student: \'Site\' and \'Project Group\'. However,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;OK to load just a single metadata type or as many as needed could be added in one load.&nbsp;It is also possible to edit a CSV file and then re-import it into Rogo and the student values will be altered. This can be useful if you need to change a particular value for a student(s) or add some extra students in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPaper Settings\r\nOnce the metadata information has been loaded for a module it can then be used for any papers assigned to that module. To do this go into a paper and select \'Edit Properties\' from the sidebar menu.&nbsp;Next click on the \'Security\' tab and in the bottom right corner is a \'Restrict to Metadata\' box. In the example below we could have the metadata field \'Branch\' set to \'any\' while set \'Site\' to \'Derby\'. To relax all metadata restrictions for a paper set all metadata types to \'&lt;any&gt;\'.\r\n\r\nStudent View\r\nThe example screenshot below shows a security warning when a student logs into an assessment (or survey) where one or more pieces of metadata do not match their own profile. In the example below the paper Example Exam has had \'Derby\' applied as a site and a test student has logged in but her site is \'Lincoln\'. She is on the correct module but her metadata does not match so the interface displays a warning above the \'Start\' button and start is disabled. Any students in this module which have the metadata site set to \'Derby\' would be allowed to take the exam.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'cs',276,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(510,'Summative Exams/Central Scheduling','<p><strong>Note:</strong> \'Summative Scheduling\' only applies to summative exam paper types.</p>\r\n<h2>Purpose</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is critical that the properties of summative exams are correctly set, after all students may depend on these exams to get through their modules.

Next select \'Create new Hofstee method\' and the system will graph the student performance on this exam (see below).\r\n\r\nAt the top there is a summary of broad statistics on the cohort: number of students, max, min, quartile 1, 2 and 3. Below this are two graphs, the one on the left dictates the pass mark and the one on the right distinction mark. On each graph the two horizontal red lines and two vertical green lines can be dragged into position using the mouse. This sets the upper and lower bounds of the number of students passing the exam. As the lines are dragged a diagonal grey line will cut through the plotted student data and the intersect point (or cut score) plotted.\r\nAt the bottom there are three options for adjusting the pass/distinction mark of the paper:\r\n\r\nNo change to paper - this will save the current Hofstee standard setting but will not alter the pass mark or distinction mark of the paper.\r\nSet paper pass/distinction marks to standard setting - this will adjust the paper pass mark and distinction mark to that of the two graphs above.\r\nSet paper to standard setting and scale marks - this will leave the paper pass and distinction marks the same but will save the current Hofstee process and scale marks accordingly. Thus, if the current paper had a pass mark of 40% then this would be scaled from the 46.95% calculated above.

Students can be notified that the paper is available in Formative format by adding a news item to the VLE or by obtaining email addresses from student records system.\r\n(Further details)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummative AssessmentSummative assessments present in a similar way to progress tests with no answers screen at the end. However, whereas a progress test is used for monitoring progression throughout a semester or a year, a summative assessment contributes marks either in part or entirety towards a degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurveySurveys, or questionnaires, are used to create papers to elicit views and responses where there are no correct answers, for example, module evaluations. Typically, likert scales and open-ended textboxes are the most frequently used question type on a survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCE StationExaminers can use Netbooks and other small format devices to record students demonstration of various skills. (Further details)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffline Paper\r\nThis is an offline paper type supported by Rogo. The Offline Paper exam is administered and marked on paper and scores are then recorded in an Excel file, saved as a CSV file and imported into Rogo. Mapping allows&nbsp;personalised feedback to be made available to students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeer Review\r\nThis paper allows a peer review to be completed in Rogo.

Dr S Burge has flagged the comment as minor and written a short message, Professor J Mclaughlin has not yet review the question and Mr G Smith thinks the question is OK and has not written any comment. If changes are required to a question then the  icon can be used to edit the question.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nUon Academics Respond to Comments/Amend Questions\r\nThe \'Comments\' tab will display the same comments as the report on the previous screen. By default all comments are \'Not actioned\'. There are two options that can be selected from the dropdown menus: 1) Read - disagree and 2) Read - actioned. The \'Internal Response\' textbox can be used to provide a brief note of what was changed. This information is useful as an internal audit in case an external may ask what was done in an exam board meeting.\r\n\r\n\'Closing the Loop\' with the External\r\nAfter the review period has ended, External Examiners have access to a paper up to one week after the exam has been taken. This should provide enough time for the examiner to go back into the paper and read what actions and responses the exam author wishes to take. The first screenshot below shows the internal response added below the externals comments with a green \'Read - actioned\' status.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below shows an internal response with red \'Read- disagree\' status.\r\n\r\nNote: Externals can no longer change their comments after the review deadline for the paper, but they may still read&nbsp;responses to their comments for up to one week after the exam was taken.','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'pl',333,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(592,'Papers/Properties','<h2>\'General\' tab</h2>\r\n<h3>Paper Details</h3>\r\n<p><strong><em>Paper Name</em></strong></p>\r\n<div>The name of a paper must be completely unique in Rogo.

In the example below, concerning questionnaire response rates, two variables are used: the first is a random number between 300 and 800 (incrementing in 100 values), and the second variable is a random integer between 10 and the calculated value of the first variable.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"image_brd\" src=\"images/calculation_question1.png\" alt=\"Calculation question presentation\" width=\"556\" height=\"145\" /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be a bit more specific the question author has explicitly stated that the answer should be expressed to one decimal place. The author has also added a \'%\' character for the units; this is added at the end of the answer textbox.</p>\r\n<h2>Marking</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the marking screen the user\'s answer is presented together with the correct answer displayed emboldened. If the user\'s answer is equal to the correct answer or within a predetermined tolerance a tick is displayed and marks awarded. The number of marks awarded for a question can be set within the editor (1 to 20), in the example below 1 mark is awarded for a correct answer. Partial marks can also be set for answers close to the correct answer. Like the marks for the correct answer, a tolerance and value is set for the partial mark.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"image_brd\" src=\"images/calculation_answer.png\" alt=\"Calculation question marking\" width=\"543\" height=\"192\" /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As can be seen in the example above the feedback, displayed in dark red, can also use the generated variables to really clarify how to calculate the answer.</p>\r\n<h2>Creating</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A calculation question consists of one or more variables used to construct a randomised question which changes each time attempted. To create the questionnaire response rate question displayed above, the following settings could be used. As shown below, two variables $A and $B are used. $A, the number of questionnaires sent out is set to be a random variable between 300 and 800. To make it more realistic the increment level is set to 100 so the only possible values that can be generated are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800. The number of responses, variable $B, is set to be between 10 and whatever value is generated for variable $A. In this case the increment level is set to 1.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer is checked against the value entered into the \'formula\' field. In the example below the basic calculation is divide $B by $A and then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage. This should be expressed using brackets to set the priority: ($B / $A) * 100. In some instances the generated values of $A and $B could result in an answer with a recurring number of decimal places. Also, the question stated that answers should be expressed to one decimal place. To do this the function \'round\' has been used (<a href=\"#functions\">see functions below</a>). A tolerance value can also be added, please note this is an absolute value. The number of marks that can be given for a correct answer may also be selected. Partial marks can be set if \'Tolerance for Partial Marks\' is set.

The question to link to is selected using the link icon next to the \'Min\' and \'Max\' fields. In the example shown below, variable $B is generated from the students answer to a previous question. Even if the student answered the initial question incorrectly they can still answer the linked question correctly as it is using the answer they gave in the earlier question.

In the example below, concerning questionnaire response rates, two variables are used: the first is a random number between 300 and 800 (incrementing in 100 values), and the second variable is a random integer between 10 and the calculated value of the first variable.\r\n\r\nTo be a bit more specific the question author has explicitly stated that the answer should be expressed to one decimal place. The author has also added a \'%\' character for the units; this is added at the end of the answer textbox.\r\nMarking\r\nOn the marking screen the user\'s answer is presented together with the correct answer displayed emboldened. If the user\'s answer is equal to the correct answer or within a predetermined tolerance a tick is displayed and marks awarded. The number of marks awarded for a question can be set within the editor (1 to 20), in the example below 1 mark is awarded for a correct answer. Partial marks can also be set for answers close to the correct answer. Like the marks for the correct answer, a tolerance and value is set for the partial mark.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the example above the feedback, displayed in dark red, can also use the generated variables to really clarify how to calculate the answer.\r\nCreating\r\nA calculation question consists of one or more variables used to construct a randomised question which changes each time attempted. To create the questionnaire response rate question displayed above, the following settings could be used. As shown below, two variables $A and $B are used. $A, the number of questionnaires sent out is set to be a random variable between 300 and 800. To make it more realistic the increment level is set to 100 so the only possible values that can be generated are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800. The number of responses, variable $B, is set to be between 10 and whatever value is generated for variable $A. In this case the increment level is set to 1.\r\nThe answer is checked against the value entered into the \'formula\' field. In the example below the basic calculation is divide $B by $A and then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage. This should be expressed using brackets to set the priority: ($B / $A) * 100. In some instances the generated values of $A and $B could result in an answer with a recurring number of decimal places. Also, the question stated that answers should be expressed to one decimal place. To do this the function \'round\' has been used (see functions below). A tolerance value can also be added, please note this is an absolute value. The number of marks that can be given for a correct answer may also be selected. Partial marks can be set if \'Tolerance for Partial Marks\' is set. Until Partial Marks are set the Allow partial Marks Marking Method is not available.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nStudent answers\r\nNote for very small or large number answers: students should not use exponential indication (e.g. 1e-5 or 1x10-5) for large or small numbers since this format does not register and&nbsp;they will be awarded zero. The units of each answer, where required, should be stated next to the answer box.\r\n\r\nLinked questions\r\nIt is possible to link two different calculation questions together by using the student\'s answer to the first question in the latter question. The question to link to is selected using the link icon next to the \'Min\' and \'Max\' fields. In the example shown below, variable $B is generated from the students answer to a previous question. Even if the student answered the initial question incorrectly they can still answer the linked question correctly as it is using the answer they gave in the earlier question. The same process can be used to use the same variables between questions on different screens.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote1: As student answers are stored as they move between screens, questions must be on different screens to allow a student\'s answer to be used in a following question. If a student has not answered the earlier question warnings will appear and the answer textbox disabled.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote2: If you copy linked questions to another paper the variable links will need to be reset\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFunctions\r\nAny of the following functions can be used in the answer formula.

The external examiners are from other institutions and have a wider view of the subject covered in a given question. See the \'External Examiners\' help page for further details.\r\nTrack Changes\r\nDetails of changes made to a question after the Peer and External Examiner reviews are recorded by Rogo and can be viewed from the question editor. The screenshot below shows the details that are recorded.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPaper/Question Locking\r\nOnce a summative exam has run, the paper and all questions that it links to are locked and cannot be amended. This ensures that the questions in the bank accurately match the results of the exam.\r\nQuestion Correction\r\nWhen analysing the results of an exam you may find that an unexpected number of students have been marked as incorrectly answering a particular question. Although questions are locked after a summative exam has run, if the correct answer for a question has been set incorrectly it is possible to change this post exam. The answer for the question can be changed in the question editor, clicking the \'Correct\' button then allows Rogo to recalculate the student marks. Please note: it is not possible to change any other parts of the question and it is also not possible to correct \'Labelling\' and \'Fill-in-the-Blank\' questions. For further information see the \'Correcting Mistakes\' help page.\r\nQuestion Exclusion\r\nIf after analysing the results of an exam it is decided that a question has not effectively assessed student knowledge it is possible to exclude it from the results.

There are 6 categories which can be thought of as levels of difficulty where one must be mastered before moving to the next one.

Objectives are the individual stages that learners must achieve on the way in order to reach these goals. For example a teacher might have an aim that a student should be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. However to achieve this aim a series of objectives must be met. e.g. to explain procedure to patient, to position cuff correctly, to inflate to correct pressure etc., etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lecturer might have as an overall aim that students should understand the relationship between protein structure and function. To achieve this aim the following objectives might have to be met: describe amino acid structure, list common categories of amino acid, explain how peptide bonds are formed, describe how covalent, ionic and hydrophobic interactions create secondary and tertiary structures, etc., etc.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are general, objectives are specific.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>There are more objectives than aims.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are like strategy, objective are like tactics.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aims and objectives can form hierarchical structures so that in complex curricula aims at one level might be seen as objectives at another.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>What are the main categories of learning objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learning objectives are aimed at the three domains of learning: knowledge, skills and attitudes.

Many things can be potentially learned during a teaching episode but you will use your judgement to focus on the most important outcomes for your learners at that stage of their course. For instance if you want them to be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer after you have demonstrated the procedure that would constitute your aim. But to achieve that they will have to have attained a series of objectives on the way. Some of these objectives might include the basic knowledge behind cardiovascular physiology such as the sequence of the cardiac cycle, systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume etc. etc. Further skill objectives might include communicating with patients, explaining procedures etc. Finally the skills of the procedure itself broken down into suitable steps. So the aims and objectives for one possible teaching sequence might look like the following:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid black; width: 85%; background-color: #ffffee;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Aims:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The student should be able to measure blood pressure on a colleague/patient using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (to an accuracy of +/- 10mm Hg).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Can describe the cardiac cycle and explain the terms systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Can effectively communicate instructions to patient concerning the procedure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Fits and inflates cuff to appropriate pressure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Releases pressure carefully and uses stethoscope to listen to brachial artery and Korotkow sounds.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Deflates cuff.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Records systolic and diastolic pressure correctly.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the case of more knowledge orientated aims and objectives imagine you are going to give a lecture with the aim of ensuring that students understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the various factors that influence enzyme reactions.

You can change the active verb to a more complex one or you can add specific conditions or limits.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example simple objectives might be to list or state facts, formulae or definitions, essentially recalling information from memory and reproducing it. More complex objectives might ask learners to apply or use knowledge in a particular context that might not have been met before. This is more cognitively demanding and really tests whether learners have deeply understood concepts. Finally the highest levels of objectives ask learners to solve complex problems by, for example evaluating or analysing evidence or synthesizing information. To critically evaluate the causes of something involves not only a deep understanding of detailed factual information but also an ability to make complex judgments about the validity of evidence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Conditions that could be added to objectives might include modifications to the circumstances in which they are carried out. \'Given a diagram of the inner ear correctly labels X, Y and Z\' is easier than having to draw a diagram from scratch. Similarly \'describe quantitatively\' is more demanding than just \'describe\' and \'describe quantitatively using data from published studies\' implies a familiarity with the primary literature that only the advanced student might have.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certain objectives can be modified by the degree to which they need to be completed. Explain in detail is more complex than in outline. Measure to 95% accuracy is harder than simply measuring without any degree of accuracy given.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"why\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>Why do we have to use learning objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"why\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are a number of ways of thinking about this question. The quickest answer is that all teachers in higher education have to use learning objectives. The Quality Assurance Agency (the quality control branch of the Higher Education Funding Council) specify that all taught sessions must have learning objectives. QAA observers, when conducting a subject review, use an observation protocol that includes monitoring the learning objectives of the teacher. QAA observers have the right to watch any teacher teach and can ask them what their learning objectives are.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A related view revolves around questions of quality and audit. If you don\'t know what you\'re trying to produce how can you be sure your teaching methods and techniques are working? If you have no objective standards how can you monitor your teaching effectiveness and how can you improve? Since all teachers must evaluate their teaching they must know what their output is.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From a curriculum perspective the learning objectives from each taught session should fit together coherently building towards the overall aims of each module and the whole curriculum. If learning objectives are not know for each session then it is impossible to see how the whole curriculum fits together. It becomes impossible for teachers in different phases of the curriculum to see what students have learned in other areas making managing and auditing the curriculum more difficult. In the case of the medical curriculum having many sessions without pre-defined learning objectives leads to a \'hidden\' curriculum rather than the goal of an integrated curriculum.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"advantages\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>What are the advantages of using learning objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"advantages\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From an educational perspective learning objectives define learning outcomes and focus teaching. They help to clarify, organize and prioritize learning. They help students evaluate their own progress and encourage them to take responsibility for their learning.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"readaround\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>I want my students to \'read around the subject\'. Don\'t learning objectives narrow the range of student learning?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"readaround\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Medicine is such an enormous subject that some boundaries have to be placed on the learning required to become a pre-registration house officer. The General Medical Council in Tomorrow\'s Doctors specifically recommended a reduction in factual knowledge. Specific aims and learning objectives are therefore essential in defining core knowledge, skills and attitudes. Students are free to learn more if they so wish but learning objectives should define the \'bottom line\'. Individual teachers may wish that students learn more about their own favourite areas but this has to be seen in the context of the overall curriculum and has to be argued with the appropriate course co-ordinator or curriculum committee. On the other hand if it is decided that \'reading around the subject\' is a fundamental requirement of some components of the course then appropriate learning objectives can be defined for this outcome.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"individual\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>We have module objectives, why do we need objectives for individual teaching sessions?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"individual\"></a></p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">From a curriculum perspective the learning objectives from each taught session should fit together coherently, building towards the overall aims of each module and the whole curriculum.

However the connection between teaching and learning is not a simple one. Just because knowledge or skills are taught does not mean that particular knowledge or skills are learned.

Objectives are the individual stages that learners must achieve on the way in order to reach these goals. For example a teacher might have an aim that a student should be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. However to achieve this aim a series of objectives must be met. e.g. to explain procedure to patient, to position cuff correctly, to inflate to correct pressure etc., etc.\r\nA lecturer might have as an overall aim that students should understand the relationship between protein structure and function. To achieve this aim the following objectives might have to be met: describe amino acid structure, list common categories of amino acid, explain how peptide bonds are formed, describe how covalent, ionic and hydrophobic interactions create secondary and tertiary structures, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAims are general, objectives are specific.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more objectives than aims.\r\n\r\n\r\nAims are like strategy, objective are like tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAims and objectives can form hierarchical structures so that in complex curricula aims at one level might be seen as objectives at another.\r\n\r\nWhat are the main categories of learning objectives?\r\n\r\nLearning objectives are aimed at the three domains of learning: knowledge, skills and attitudes. These are also termed the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains of learning.\r\n\r\nHow do you write aims and learning objectives?\r\n\r\nAs a teacher you will need to decide what you want your learners to be able to DO after they have learned something that you have taught. Many things can be potentially learned during a teaching episode but you will use your judgement to focus on the most important outcomes for your learners at that stage of their course. For instance if you want them to be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer after you have demonstrated the procedure that would constitute your aim. But to achieve that they will have to have attained a series of objectives on the way. Some of these objectives might include the basic knowledge behind cardiovascular physiology such as the sequence of the cardiac cycle, systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume etc. etc. Further skill objectives might include communicating with patients, explaining procedures etc. Finally the skills of the procedure itself broken down into suitable steps. So the aims and objectives for one possible teaching sequence might look like the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims:\r\nThe student should be able to measure blood pressure on a colleague/patient using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (to an accuracy of +/- 10mm Hg).\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n\r\nCan describe the cardiac cycle and explain the terms systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan effectively communicate instructions to patient concerning the procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\nFits and inflates cuff to appropriate pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nReleases pressure carefully and uses stethoscope to listen to brachial artery and Korotkow sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeflates cuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords systolic and diastolic pressure correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of more knowledge orientated aims and objectives imagine you are going to give a lecture with the aim of ensuring that students understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the various factors that influence enzyme reactions. Here you need to break the knowledge down into smaller components that logically build towards the final goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims:\r\nTo understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the factors that influence enzyme reactions.\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n\r\nState the different categories of amino acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplain what a peptide bond is and how polypeptides are formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nState the four levels of protein structure and explain how the sequence of amino acids leads to the final three dimensional configuration of the protein.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplain how variations in pH, ion concentration and temperature influence the three dimensional configuration of a protein.\r\n\r\n\r\nState that an enzyme is a protein designed to catalyse a specific chemical reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nState that an enzyme speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy of the transition complex and that it does not influence the equilibrium or overall energy change of a reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplain how variations in pH, ion concentration and temperature influence catalytic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe how enzyme activity can be regulated by other molecules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that objectives do not include the word \'know\' or \'understand\'. They do include active verbs such as \'state\', \'explain\', \'outline\', \'list\' or \'describe\'. Know and understand do not specify any overt \'doing\' and although knowing and understanding underpin learning, objectives are always written using active doing verbs. They are statements of what you want your learners to do. At the end of the day being a doctor, nurse or dentist is about doing things not just knowing things.\r\n\r\nExamples of learning objectives verbs\r\n\r\nThe following lists contains examples of verbs which describe the sorts of things you want your students to be able to do and may help you to write useful learning objectives.\r\nKnowledge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanalyse\r\narrange\r\ncalculate\r\ncircle\r\ncite\r\n\r\n\r\nclassify\r\ncompare\r\ncontrast\r\ncompare\r\ndefine\r\n\r\n\r\ndescribe\r\ndiagram\r\ndifferentiate\r\ngroup\r\nidentify\r\n\r\n\r\ninterpret\r\nitemize\r\nlabel\r\nlist\r\nmatch\r\n\r\n\r\nname\r\noutline\r\nplan\r\nrecord\r\nrevise\r\n\r\n\r\nselect\r\nsolve\r\nstate\r\ntabulate\r\ngive examples\r\n\r\n\r\nevaluate\r\nrecognise\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadjust\r\nassemble\r\nchart\r\ncollect\r\nuse\r\n\r\n\r\ndraw\r\nemploy\r\nestablish\r\nillustrate\r\nimitate\r\n\r\n\r\ninteract\r\nlocate\r\nmaintain\r\nmeasure\r\nmodify\r\n\r\n\r\noperate\r\norganise\r\nrearrange\r\nreturn\r\nset up\r\n\r\n\r\npractice\r\nmanipulate\r\nmaster\r\nfit\r\nperform\r\n\r\n\r\ndemonstrate\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttitudes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccept\r\nadopt\r\nadvocate\r\napprove\r\nassess\r\n\r\n\r\nchallenge\r\ncharacterise\r\nchoose\r\ncriticise\r\ndefend\r\n\r\n\r\nevaluate\r\nformulate\r\njudge\r\njustify\r\nmanage\r\n\r\n\r\nmodel\r\npersuade\r\nrecommend\r\nresolve\r\nselect\r\n\r\n\r\nspecify\r\nvalue\r\nre-assure\r\nempathise\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I modify learning objectives to make them more demanding?\r\n\r\nLearning objectives can be made more difficult or demanding depending on the degree of understanding or levels of experience of learners. You can change the active verb to a more complex one or you can add specific conditions or limits.\r\nFor example simple objectives might be to list or state facts, formulae or definitions, essentially recalling information from memory and reproducing it. More complex objectives might ask learners to apply or use knowledge in a particular context that might not have been met before. This is more cognitively demanding and really tests whether learners have deeply understood concepts. Finally the highest levels of objectives ask learners to solve complex problems by, for example evaluating or analysing evidence or synthesizing information. To critically evaluate the causes of something involves not only a deep understanding of detailed factual information but also an ability to make complex judgments about the validity of evidence.\r\nConditions that could be added to objectives might include modifications to the circumstances in which they are carried out. \'Given a diagram of the inner ear correctly labels X, Y and Z\' is easier than having to draw a diagram from scratch. Similarly \'describe quantitatively\' is more demanding than just \'describe\' and \'describe quantitatively using data from published studies\' implies a familiarity with the primary literature that only the advanced student might have.\r\nCertain objectives can be modified by the degree to which they need to be completed. Explain in detail is more complex than in outline. Measure to 95% accuracy is harder than simply measuring without any degree of accuracy given.\r\n\r\nWhy do we have to use learning objectives?\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways of thinking about this question. The quickest answer is that all teachers in higher education have to use learning objectives. The Quality Assurance Agency (the quality control branch of the Higher Education Funding Council) specify that all taught sessions must have learning objectives. QAA observers, when conducting a subject review, use an observation protocol that includes monitoring the learning objectives of the teacher. QAA observers have the right to watch any teacher teach and can ask them what their learning objectives are.\r\nA related view revolves around questions of quality and audit. If you don\'t know what you\'re trying to produce how can you be sure your teaching methods and techniques are working? If you have no objective standards how can you monitor your teaching effectiveness and how can you improve? Since all teachers must evaluate their teaching they must know what their output is.\r\nFrom a curriculum perspective the learning objectives from each taught session should fit together coherently building towards the overall aims of each module and the whole curriculum. If learning objectives are not know for each session then it is impossible to see how the whole curriculum fits together. It becomes impossible for teachers in different phases of the curriculum to see what students have learned in other areas making managing and auditing the curriculum more difficult. In the case of the medical curriculum having many sessions without pre-defined learning objectives leads to a \'hidden\' curriculum rather than the goal of an integrated curriculum.\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages of using learning objectives?\r\n\r\nFrom an educational perspective learning objectives define learning outcomes and focus teaching. They help to clarify, organize and prioritize learning. They help students evaluate their own progress and encourage them to take responsibility for their learning.\r\n\r\nI want my students to \'read around the subject\'. Don\'t learning objectives narrow the range of student learning?\r\n\r\nMedicine is such an enormous subject that some boundaries have to be placed on the learning required to become a pre-registration house officer. The General Medical Council in Tomorrow\'s Doctors specifically recommended a reduction in factual knowledge. Specific aims and learning objectives are therefore essential in defining core knowledge, skills and attitudes. Students are free to learn more if they so wish but learning objectives should define the \'bottom line\'. Individual teachers may wish that students learn more about their own favourite areas but this has to be seen in the context of the overall curriculum and has to be argued with the appropriate course co-ordinator or curriculum committee. On the other hand if it is decided that \'reading around the subject\' is a fundamental requirement of some components of the course then appropriate learning objectives can be defined for this outcome.\r\n\r\nWe have module objectives, why do we need objectives for individual teaching sessions?\r\n\r\nFrom a curriculum perspective the learning objectives from each taught session should fit together coherently, building towards the overall aims of each module and the whole curriculum. If learning objectives are not known for each session then it is impossible to see how the whole curriculum fits together. It becomes impossible for teachers in different phases of the curriculum to see what students have learned in other areas making managing and auditing the curriculum more difficult. In the case of the medical curriculum having many sessions without pre-defined learning objectives leads to a \'hidden\' curriculum rather than the goal of an integrated curriculum.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSession objectives are mapped to assessment questions in Rogo meaning that the exams results can provide a report on the effectiveness of teaching of the objectives.','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL,'pl',226,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(676,'Equation Editor','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Equations Editor is used to&nbsp;include equations within text fields when creating questions.
