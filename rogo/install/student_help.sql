For example, a calculation question could be set to award half a mark if a student got close to the correct answer. Staff often include a tollerance on calculation questions to take into account rounding errors. With ranking questions these are sometimes set to allow partial marks if the correct rank is awared to neighbouring options.</p>\r\n<h2>Bonus Marks</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranking type questions can be set to award a bonus mark if all options are correct.</p>\r\n<h2>Random Mark</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With examinations using question types such as dichotomous, multiple choice, multiple response and extended matching, the user is asked to select the correct answer from the list of possible alternatives. However, given the fact that the correct answer is always one of the items in the list, as opposed to a short essay question where no answer is provided, there is always a statistically likelihood or probability that a user might select the correct answer by chance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The \'random mark\' is the score one would expect if someone answered all the questions on a paper at random. It is generated by totally the individual random marks for each individual question. Different types of question have different probabilities. For example, with a 5 option multiple choice question there is a 1 in 5 chance that the user will select the right answer by accident. To calculate the random mark in this example the system will take a fifth of the marks for that question. So if the question is worth one mark then the random mark will be 0.2 marks. In another example a dichotomous (True/False) question with only 2 options will have a 1 in 2 chance which results in 0.5 random marks. The system goes through all the questions summing all the individual random marks to produce a final total which is displayed on-screen.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the random mark is generated it is used to scale, or factor out, the random element from the user\'s mark. This is done by calculating what is know as an <em>adjusted percentage</em>. To do this the random mark is subtracted from the user\'s <em>raw </em>mark. The same random mark is then subtracted from the total possible marks available for the paper and the two figures expressed as a percentage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br /> Student mark = 150<br /> Total possible marks = 200<br /> Calculated Random mark = 45</p>\r\n<p><strong>Adjusted Percentage:</strong><br /> 150 - 45 = 105<br /> 200 - 45 = 155<br /> (105 / 155) * 100 = 67.7% (adjusted)</p>','Where questions have a number of parts that can be marked independently the Marking Method can be set to mark either by question or by option.\r\nMark per Option\r\nIn the example below the student is awarded 2 marks because two of the options (Paris and Prague) are correct.

Staff often include a tollerance on calculation questions to take into account rounding errors. With ranking questions these are sometimes set to allow partial marks if the correct rank is awared to neighbouring options.\r\nBonus Marks\r\nRanking type questions can be set to award a bonus mark if all options are correct.\r\nRandom Mark\r\nWith examinations using question types such as dichotomous, multiple choice, multiple response and extended matching, the user is asked to select the correct answer from the list of possible alternatives. However, given the fact that the correct answer is always one of the items in the list, as opposed to a short essay question where no answer is provided, there is always a statistically likelihood or probability that a user might select the correct answer by chance.\r\nThe \'random mark\' is the score one would expect if someone answered all the questions on a paper at random. It is generated by totally the individual random marks for each individual question. Different types of question have different probabilities. For example, with a 5 option multiple choice question there is a 1 in 5 chance that the user will select the right answer by accident. To calculate the random mark in this example the system will take a fifth of the marks for that question. So if the question is worth one mark then the random mark will be 0.2 marks. In another example a dichotomous (True/False) question with only 2 options will have a 1 in 2 chance which results in 0.5 random marks. The system goes through all the questions summing all the individual random marks to produce a final total which is displayed on-screen.\r\nWhen the random mark is generated it is used to scale, or factor out, the random element from the user\'s mark. This is done by calculating what is know as an adjusted percentage. To do this the random mark is subtracted from the user\'s raw mark. The same random mark is then subtracted from the total possible marks available for the paper and the two figures expressed as a percentage.\r\nExample Student mark = 150 Total possible marks = 200 Calculated Random mark = 45\r\nAdjusted Percentage: 150 - 45 = 105 200 - 45 = 155 (105 / 155) * 100 = 67.7% (adjusted)','page',NULL,NULL,NULL,'cs',43,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(67,'Question Types/Labelling','<h2>Presentation</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Labelling questions&nbsp;have a&nbsp;graphic with a number of empty rectangular \'placeholders\' over it.

Repeat this selection of points all the way around the area until back at the starting point (green dot). As a shortcut the user may double-click to insert a point at the current mouse location and automatically join up with the start point.\r\n\r\nAdjusting&nbsp;Answer\r\nThere are two main ways to adjust, or edit, an answer. The first is to click and drag&nbsp;the square points (in black). This will adjust the two connected lines with the current point\'s neighbours. The second type of adjustment that can be made is to click and drag one of the circle points (in white). This will break a line in two and insert a square point in the centre. This can be used to insert additional points for a more accurate overall shape. To remove a point (black square) first select \'Delete point\' from the toolbar and then click the point to be removed.\r\nMarking and Feedback\r\nMarks can be given for correctly selected requested area of the graphic by question. Negative marks can also be given for incorrect responses. Depending on the feedback settings for the paper, ticks/crosses, user\'s area, correct area and the error area on the graphic can be displayed for each tab.\r\nThe three screenshots below show the feedback that is available. The first example shows where the student answers. The second shows the student answer and the correct answer superimposed in green. The third exampl shows the student answer together with the error in red/pink. The error shows the difference between the student area and the correct area.\r\n','page',NULL,NULL,NULL,'cs',44,'0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(75,'Feedback/Formative Feedback','<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Feedback options are set for individual papers and may include the following:</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Correct Answers/Text Feedback</h2>\r\n<div>The text feedback on the graphic below gives specific feedback for the options selected and the correct option that was missed by the student.</div>\r\n<p><img class=\"image_brd\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;\" src=\"images/new student formative feedback2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"405\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>\r\n<p>If a paper has been mapped to learning objectives then these will appear beneath the question.
