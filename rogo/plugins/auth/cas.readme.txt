A few notes related to the CAS module:

* Users of the CAS module would have to modify the code to suit their needs. They may either:
	1. Display the CAS login page if no user is logged in/let authenticated users through OR
	2. Check if a CAS user is authenticated and automatically route them to the appropriate page; otherwise, use another form of authentication. This doesn't require the CAS library; it only makes use of the variable $_SESSION['phpCAS']['user'].
	
	Option 1 is known as "forcing authentication". This method would apply to users who only want to use CAS for authentication. This functionality has been included but commented out in the code.
	Option 2 is for users who use CAS among other authentication methods and don't want to display the CAS login page within Rogō.

* The CAS configuration file is unnecessary when using basic CAS settings but it needs to be included if users want to use some advanced settings e.g. change the session name.
* I have the document root referenced as "$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']" due to its location on our server.
* I commented out code relating to the login button as it is not needed for automatic CAS login.
