Cosign filter implementation in PHP
Version 0.9.1
Copyright (c) 2010,2012 FIT Brno University of Technology
See attached LICENSE file

FEATURES:

- Cosign v0/v2/v3 client protocol in PHP
- Cosign v3 validation service (compatible with Apache filter implementation)
- Kerberos ticket retrieval support (not tested)
- Multiple Cosignd server support (DNS load balancing)

LIMITATIONS:

- PHP-5.2.x and greater (tested in 5.2.12-17, don't use 5.3.9 or 5.3.10)
- PHP compiled with SSL socket transport (--with-openssl)
- No persistent cosignd connections (SSL setup cost during cookie file
  validation, in default setup once per 60 seconds/client)
- No proxy support
- Factor support not tested

INSTALLATION

Before you begin:

For documentation and information see: http://weblogin.org/

Notice, that documentation on the Web is not up to date. The only valid
documentation is in the latest cosign-3.1.1.tar.gz distribution.

Setup:

- If you want to use V3 protocol, setup validation service first:

1. Copy the php source "valid" to you Web server root directory ROOT/cosign:

	mkdir ROOT/cosign
	cp valid ROOT/cosign

2. If you are running Apache, copy also .htaccess file to this directory  
   (in other case, setup you server to execute "valid" as PHP script):

   	cp .htaccess ROOT/cosign

3. Setup appropriate access rights so the file is readable to Web server:
	
	chgrp www ROOT/cosign 
	chgrp www ROOT/cosign/valid
	chgrp www ROOT/cosign/.htaccess
	chmod 750 ROOT/cosign
	chmod 640 ROOT/cosign/valid
	chmod 640 ROOT/cosign/.htaccess

4. Modify CosignValidationErrorRedirect and CosignValidReference to
   match your setup (see cosign-3.1.1/README) in ROOT/cosign/valid:

   	vi ROOT/cosign/valid

- Copy PHP scripts cosign.php and cosign_config.php to your PHP include 
  directory (you have to setup it in php.ini!):

  	cp cosign.php cosign_config.php /usr/local/include/php

- Edit configuration file and setup all config options:

	vi /usr/local/include/php/cosign_config.php

1. Certificate file - copy Cosign client certificate and private key
   in PEM format to one file (CosignCryptoLocalCert)

2. CA certificate to verify Cosign server certificate (CosignCryptoCAFile)

3. Cosign server hostname (CosignHostname) and URL (CosignRedirect)

4. Cosign service (CosignService)

5. Cookie directory location (CosignFilterDB - must be writable by your Web 
   server!)
	
6. Filter log file (CosignFilterLog)

7. Setup Cosign protocol version (CosignProtocolVersion). Version 2 filter
   can communicate with version 3 cosignd server (if allowed in cosign.conf).

8. Leave debug output initially on (CosignFilterDebug)

Configuration options are merged from the global configuration file
(cosign_config.php), local configuration file (.cosign.php in Web page
directory) and the first argument in cosign_auth() call.
All configuration options have the same meaning as in the original Apache 
filter module. Only boolean options have different values false (off) and 
true (on).

USAGE

Each page that is protected by Cosign must call cosign_auth() function
at the beginning:

<?php
// Some Web page in PHP
	require_once("cosign.php");
	if (cosign_auth()) {	// Authentication OK
	    echo "Authenticated as ".$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']."<br>";
	} else {		// Authentication failure
	    echo "Not authenticated";
	    die();
	}
....
?>

Function cosign_auth(array, boolean):

The first argument is configuration options array. Your script can
localy change any configuration option from cosign_config.php.
The second argument can suppress internal ob_start() in cosign_auth(),
if your script is doing it:

<?php
// Some Web page with ob_start()
	ob_start();
	require_once("cosign.php");
	...
	if (cosign_auth(array(), false)) { 	...
	...
?>

After setup verification and testing, change CosignFilterDebug to false
to suppress debug logging.

BUG REPORTS

SECURITY NOTICE

Filter Certificate file has to be readable by Web server executing PHP
scripts. That means, any user PHP script on this Web server can read this
Certificate file (and its private key). Don't use Web server certificate
as Cosign Filter Certificate! If Cosign Filter Certificate is used only 
for cosign client verification, its disclosure should be probably harmless.
