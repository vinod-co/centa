Stage 1: Question Categorisation In the first step each question, or part of a question worth a mark, needs to be categorised on two orthogonal dimensions: 1) difficulty, and 2) importance. As the diagram below shows, the \'difficulty\' dimension has three categories: easy, medium and hard. The \'importance\' dimension has essential, important and nice to know categories. Each question can be plotted on this two dimensional space creating a 3 x 3 matrix: To actually start the categorisation process go into the paper to be standards set and then click on the \'Standards Setting\' menu option on the left. Next select \'Create new Ebel method\' and the screen will change to show the whole paper with blue dropdown lists next to each item requiring categorisation.

To make it more realistic the increment level is set to 100 so the only possible values that can be generated are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800.

In some instances the generated values of $A and $B could result in an answer with a recurring number of decimal places. Also, the question stated that answers should be expressed to one decimal place.

The first two (\'by Session\' and \'by Question\') are useful to see what questions an assessment is sampling as an exam is being prepared. In some cases the decision to write additional questions may be taken to ensure adequate sampling from the whole module. The other report, \'Learning Objective Analysis\' is then used once the assessment has taken place and can show how well the cohort as a whole achieved each objective. by Session The \'by session\' report (see below) shows all the session-level learning objectives for a particular module. Where an objective is covered by a question on the current assessment it will be displayed in black and have the question number appended in orange. In the example below, the objective \'Define the terms aetiology, pathogenesis, natural history and prognosis\' has been mapped to question number 14. This report is particularly useful in seeing at a glance how a module\'s objectives are sampled by the current assessment. Note for Medical School users: It is possible to click on the session title in blue (or the shortcut icon) and bring up that particular session of the NLE in a new window. by Question The \'by Question\' report complements \'by Session\' but this time is displayed in question order. This report is good for seeing which sessions contribute to which questions. For example, Question 5 below assesses objectives from both CLS/L1/08 and CLS/l1/11. Note for Medical School users: Click on these hyperlinks to bring the required session in the NLE up in a new window. &nbsp; Learning Objective Analysis This report can be found from the \'Analysis Menu\'. It shows in ranked order of best performance how well the cohort as a whole achieved each objective. The percentage score next to the icon is the percentage of the cohort getting questions mapped to the objective correct. &nbsp; This report, particularly the least well answered objectives at the bottom, can be used to improve teaching and tackle areas of weakness. &nbsp; ','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL),(147,'Mapping/Objectives','137',NULL,'pointer',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL),(145,'Objectives/Student Feedback','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to being able to clearly see how an assessment samples the objectives of a module, another huge benefit is the personalised feedback that can be given to students.

An item difficulty of 0.0 indicates a very hard question (no-one got it right), while a value of 1.0 shows a very easy question (no-one got it wrong). Questions that have item difficulties of more than 0.75 or less than 0.25 are less effective in differentiating users. An ideal value is 0.5.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIf the number of students getting the answer correct is under 50% (t &lt; 50%) then double-check that the correct answer has been properly set when editing the question. If this is not the case then the correct answer can be set see: Correcting Mistakes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDiscrimination ranges from -1.0 to +1.0, and is a Pearson product-moment correlation between the item and the total test score. A correlation close to +1.0 means that the question is measuring the same thing as the test. A low correlation shows that getting the question right is not related to a good test score. A negative correlation means that getting the question right associates with a low-test score.

Delay the start time of the exam if there are students who have yet to get to the \'blue screen\'. Note: This does not include students arriving at exams late.  Announce: \"You have xxx minutes starting now, please click \'Start &gt;&gt;\'\"  Ending Exams Note: The software does not automatically end an exam. The reason for this is that the exam may have started late and needs to end late too or additional time may be required to offset for a temporary loss of network time, etc. At the end of the exam make the following announcements:  \"You must stop answering questions now.\"  \"Navigate to the last screen.\"  \"Click on the &lsquo;Finish&rsquo; button in the bottom right corner of the last screen.\"  \"Press &lsquo;CTRL&rsquo;, &lsquo;ALT&rsquo; and &lsquo;DELETE&rsquo; to log out of your workstation.\"  Potential Problems In some situations either a single student or the whole of a class may get a screen similar to the one below stating that no exams can be found: The information provided on this screen is to assist in solving what the problem might be. Data provided includes:  IP Address - This is the IP address of the current computer. If Rogoï¿½ recognises it in its database then the computer lab it belongs in will be displayed in brackets. In the example above the lab is \'Coates C20\'. Check that this lab has been assigned to the assessment paper.  Time/Date - This is the current server time/date when the current paper was requested. Has the assessment paper been set for the right time/date? Check the year is correct - this can often be set into the far future.  Academic Year - This is the academic year of the currently logged in student.  Modules - A list of modules (by academic session) is listed for the currently logged in student. Is the assessment paper on the correct module? Is the current student registered on the correct module?  Roles - This is the role of the currently logged in user. A normal exam candidate should have the role \'Student\'.  The most frequent problems encountered with papers can usually be sorted by going into \'Edit Properties\' dialog box of the paper. Check the correct start/end dates have been set, has the correct computer lab been checked, has the correct module been set and in the right academic year? If making any changes in the \'Edit Properties\' dialog remember to click \'Save\' and then inform the student(s) to hit F5 on the keyboard to refresh the screen and hopefully bring up the required paper.

You can see how these questions were created by looking at the \'Question type example paper\'.&nbsp;   Area question &nbsp; The area question type is used when the student is required to trace around a particular part of an image. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Area\'&nbsp;help page.  &nbsp;  Calculation question &nbsp; The calculation question type is used when the student is required to give a numerical answer that requires the use of a formula. The question will randomly generate figures for variables that you have set. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Calculation\' help page.    Dichotomous question &nbsp; The Dichotomous question type is used when a lead in question is followed by a number of stems. There is a choice of giving the stems \'Yes/No\' or \'True/False\' options. Questions with only one Yes/No or True/False stem should be created using the \'Multiple Choice\' question type. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Dichotomous\' help page.   Extended Matching question &nbsp; This question type can be used to cover different patients that present with the same problem but under investigation show differences which lead to a different diagnosis. There is one set of available options that can be selected from for each stem of the question. &nbsp; Note: There can be more than one correct answer for each stem. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Extended Matching\' help page.    Fill-in-the-Blank question &nbsp; This question type shows a piece of text with blanks that the students must complete. Questions can either be set to ask students to type the correct answer or select from a drop down list. Selecting from a drop down list avoids the possibility of students introducing spelling mistakes but does act as a prompt as the correct answer is being selected from a list. &nbsp; If students are being asked to type the correct answer you can set the question to accept acronyms and US spellings where appropriate. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Fill-in-the-Blank\' help page.    Flash question &nbsp; If you want to create a custom question type you can create a suitable SWF Flash file and then use the Flash question type to include it in Rogo. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Flash\' help page.    Image Hotspot question &nbsp; The Image Hotpot question type is used where the student\'s ability to identify features on an image is required. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Image Hotspot\' help page.   Labelling question &nbsp; This is used when you want students to name highlighted areas of a graphic. Spaces for labels identify areas of interest but require the student to drag the correct label into the spaces. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Labelling\' help page.    Likert Scale question &nbsp; These are often used in surveys but as students need to select from a scale the data obtained from this question type allows Rogo to complete Quantitative data analysis. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Likert Scale\' help page.     Matrix question &nbsp; The Matrix question is used when there are a number of items that can be matched as shown in this example. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Matrix\' help page.    Multiple Choice question The \'Multiple Choice\' question type is used when there is only 1 correct answer and between 2 and 20 options. It can be used for True/False questions where there are 2 options (True and False). If you have a question with more than 1 correct answer you should use the \'Multiple Response\' question type. For more information see the \'Multiple Choice (MCQ)\'help page. &nbsp;   Multiple Response question &nbsp; This question type is used when the user needs to select more than one correct option. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Multiple Response\'help page. &nbsp;   Ranking question &nbsp; This question type is used when there are items that can be put in an order such as the frequency of occurance as shown in the example opposite. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Ranking\' help page.   Textbox question &nbsp; Textbox questions are mainly used in Surveys but can be used in exam papers. Rogo is not able to mark Textbox questions but does store the data captured which can then be manually marked. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Textbox\' help page.   True/False question &nbsp; This question type is used when the user needs to select either True or False. &nbsp; For more information see the \'Multiple Response\'help page. &nbsp;   ','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL),(303,'Administrative Tools/LTI Keys','<h2>Initial Configuration</h2>\r\n<p>LTI Keys are used as a mechanism for establishing trust between LTI compatible systems.

They are sometimes called learning outcomes. Learning Objectives are also statements that describe what a learner will be able to do as a result of teaching. Some definitions stress that a learning objective is a sort of contract that teachers make with learners that describes what they will be able to do after learning that they could not do before, the \'added value\' of teaching. However the connection between teaching and learning is not a simple one. Just because knowledge or skills are taught does not mean that particular knowledge or skills are learned.

Objectives are the individual stages that learners must achieve on the way in order to reach these goals. For example a teacher might have an aim that a student should be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. However to achieve this aim a series of objectives must be met. eg to explain procedure to patient, to position cuff correctly, to inflate to correct pressure etc, etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lecturer might have as an overall aim that students should understand the relationship between protein structure and function. To achieve this aim the following objectives might have to be met: describe amino acid structure, list common categories of amino acid, explain how peptide bonds are formed, describe how covalent, ionic and hydrophobic interactions create secondary and tertiary structures, etc, etc.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are general, objectives are specific.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>There are more objectives than aims.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div>Aims are like strategy, objective are like tactics.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aims and objectives can form hierarchical structures so that in complex curricula aims at one level might be seen as objectives at another.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>What are the main categories of learning objectives?</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"categories\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learning objectives are aimed at the three domains of learning: knowledge, skills and attitudes.

Many things can be potentially learned during a teaching episode but you will use your judgement to focus on the most important outcomes for your learners at that stage of their course. For instance if you want them to be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer after you have demonstrated the procedure that would constitute your aim. But to achieve that they will have to have attained a series of objectives on the way. Some of these objectives might include the basic knowledge behind cardiovascular physiology such as the sequence of the cardiac cycle, systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume etc. etc. Further skill objectives might include communicating with patients, explaining procedures etc. Finally the skills of the procedure itself broken down into suitable steps. So the aims and objectives for one possible teaching sequence might look like the following:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid black; width: 85%; background-color: #ffffee;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Aims:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The student should be able to measure blood pressure on a colleague/patient using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (to an accuracy of +/- 10mm Hg).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Can describe the cardiac cycle and explain the terms systole, diastole, cardiac output, stroke volume.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Can effectively communicate instructions to patient concerning the procedure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Fits and inflates cuff to appropriate pressure.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Releases pressure carefully and uses stethoscope to listen to brachial artery and Korotkow sounds.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<div>Deflates cuff.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Records systolic and diastolic pressure correctly.</div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the case of more knowledge orientated aims and objectives imagine you are going to give a lecture with the aim of ensuring that students understand the relationship between protein structure and function and the various factors that influence enzyme reactions.

They are sometimes called learning outcomes. Learning Objectives are also statements that describe what a learner will be able to do as a result of teaching. Some definitions stress that a learning objective is a sort of contract that teachers make with learners that describes what they will be able to do after learning that they could not do before, the \'added value\' of teaching. However the connection between teaching and learning is not a simple one. Just because knowledge or skills are taught does not mean that particular knowledge or skills are learned. Many factors can interfere with the achievement of objectives: the existing knowledge of the learner, the relevance or usefulness of the material presented, the skills of the teacher.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nObjectives are the \'desired outcomes\' of student learning and need to be set for the course both at the module and session levels. Assessments then need to be referenced to these objectives to allow them to report on the results of the teaching. Alignment between the desired outcome, how we teach and how we assess is likely to achieve more effective teaching.\r\n\r\nWhat are the difference between Aims and Objectives?\r\n\r\nAims are general statements concerning the overall goals, ends or intentions of teaching. Objectives are the individual stages that learners must achieve on the way in order to reach these goals. For example a teacher might have an aim that a student should be able to take blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer. However to achieve this aim a series of objectives must be met. eg to explain procedure to patient, to position cuff correctly, to inflate to correct pressure etc, etc.\r\nA lecturer might have as an overall aim that students should understand the relationship between protein structure and function.

On the other hand if it is decided that \'reading around the subject\' is a fundamental requirement of some components of the course then appropriate learning objectives can be defined for this outcome.\r\n\r\nWe have module objectives, why do we need objectives for individual teaching sessions?\r\n\r\nFrom a curriculum perspective the learning objectives from each taught session should fit together coherently, building towards the overall aims of each module and the whole curriculum. If learning objectives are not known for each session then it is impossible to see how the whole curriculum fits together. It becomes impossible for teachers in different phases of the curriculum to see what students have learned in other areas making managing and auditing the curriculum more difficult. In the case of the medical curriculum having many sessions without pre-defined learning objectives leads to a \'hidden\' curriculum rather than the goal of an integrated curriculum.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSession objectives are mapped to assessment questions in Rogoï¿½ meaning that the exams results can provide a report on the effectiveness of teaching of the objectives.','page',NULL,NULL,'Staff',NULL),(287,'Equation Editor','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Equations Editor is used to&nbsp;include equations within text fields when creating questions.
